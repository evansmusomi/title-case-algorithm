Algorithm Based Problem: Title Case

Description: There's some confusion about how to capitalise titles.
Create an algorithm that correctly converts a string title to the correct case.

Rules:
- The first word of the sentence should start with a capital letter
- The last word of the sentence should start with a capital letter
- Unless at the beginning or end of the sentence, the following should be lowercase: 'a', 'an', 'and', 'the', 'but', 'or', 'for', 'nor', 'on', 'at', 'to', 'from', 'by'
- Any other words in the sentence should start with a capital letter

Examples:
- "I'm a little tea pot" should return "I'm a Little Tea Pot"
- "sHoRt AnD sToUt" should return "Short and Stout"

Deliverable:
- Code that does what's described above
- Tests to ensure the examples pass

Notes:
- Programming Language: Ruby
- Test Framework: Rspec
